              <p>I'm learning Unity fundamentals and touching on related skills such as 3d modeling and animation by working on prototypes for a few different game ideas. Current prototypes are focused on procedurally generated terrain (using both procedural meshes and various forms of mesh tilesets) and 3D character and camera controllers.</p>
              <p>Everything is still very much in flux and not polished enough to publish but throwing things together has been a blast so far and has certainly been sharpening my spatial skills.</p>

              <p>I created an open-source online implementation of one of my favorite board games, Carcassone. It is feature complete and includes support for a few expansions beyond the base game. I'm quite happy with how everything turned out. The site has been running stably with >100 users for years now.</p>
              <p>As my first project built with Node and Mongo I learned a lot and really appreciate the Node ecosystem for small single-developer projects like this one. It also reinforced my growing love of D3.js. After you really grok the mental model required to use it properly for dynamic updates it makes real-time gamestate updates and animations quite simple and with an expressive code structure.</p>

              <p>I used to find a lot of new hip-hop music through a Reddit bot that would trawl the hip-hop subreddit (r/HipHopHeads) for new music posted there and generate daily and weekly newsletters with everything new being posted. When it stopped working one day I had to start looking through new posts manually for a while but was missing a lot when not checking regularly as Reddit limits fetching recent posts to the past ~3 days. I found a repo with some early source code of the original Python-based bot and after some work trying to get it up and running again decided to reimplement the bot from the ground up.</p>
              <p>I didn't end up using any of the original source but replicated the original features of the bot (archiving new posts to a database, daily and weekly newsletters via PM subscription, and posting weekly updates to the subreddit) with Node running out of a Heroku instance. After matching the previous behavior I enhanced it to archive all posts to a GitHub repo and built a GitHub Pages site to allow new music to be easily traversed with media embedding, post filtering, infinite scroll, and the ability to hide seen posts.</p>

              <p>Dojo is an online game client for my favorite (sadly now defunct and sold to new owners) trading card game, Legend of the Five Rings. At the time there were a few Magic specific clients and some generic clients built to use for any type of card game but Legend of the Five Rings includes a lot more rules than most card games with two separate decks and three game areas plus a hand for each player. Dojo implemented all the non-card specific rules specific to Legend of the Five Rings to drastically reduce the amount of user input needed to play a game and supported all the functionality needed to play complete games. It was built out on Java specifically to be cross-platform.</p>

              <p>My work involves understanding the variety of data domains across the factory and designing loaders and schemas to capture and store the data for analysis then building and supporting custom reporting and analysis systems, typically delivered to the factory as internal web apps or exposed for direct use in the one of our warehouses. Custom data visualization plays a big part of effectively communicating actionable results from the flood of data coming out of the factory. The volume and complexity of the data involved keeps this quite interesting with new requirements coming out of the factory constantly. The software we develop and deploy here in the research fab we also deploy and support across Intel's "virtual factory" network of fabs worldwide.</p>

              <p>They are a high-caliber team and were great to work with. The work itself was certainly satisfying as well. Nothing beats working the feeling of working on something technically complex and seeing it work perfectly with speedups of >1000x at the end of the day!</p>

              <p>As major CAD tools at the time could not handle TSVs or the concept 3D stacking the lab had a custom tool chain to handle the design. We developed scripts to translate and combine the labs custom layout files into a format usable with solid & thermal modeling tools and to set up and run the simulations to get thermal characteristics from the designs.</p>
